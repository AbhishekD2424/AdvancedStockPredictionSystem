The proposed model compares different machine learning algorithms to predict the stock prices of a company. The model is trained and given testing data and the  result is compared for the most accurate result which can help guide investor's decisions.
To execute the model download the code and change the path for the Import Dataset to whichever .csv file consists the history of stock data for training and testing purposes of the machine, to predict the stocks for that purticular comapny. For reference, RELIANCE.csv has been added which is a sample stock for the company Reliance.
